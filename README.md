# ðŸ¤– LARC2024 â€” Latin American Robotics Competition (Open Challenge)
This project was developed as part of our participation in the Latin American Robotics Competition (LARC) 2024 â€“ Open Challenge, focusing on the design and implementation of an autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating complex and dynamic environments.

# ðŸš€ Project Overview
Our autonomous system was designed to make real-time decisions using data from multiple onboard sensors. The robot integrated sensor fusion, path planning, and control systems to ensure both stability and adaptability in unknown environments.

## Key design goals:

Real-time autonomous navigation

Robust obstacle detection and avoidance

Accurate target identification and localization

# ðŸ”§ Key Features & Contributions
Sensor Fusion: Combined data from ultrasonic sensors, IMU, and wheel encoders to create a reliable estimate of the robot's pose and environment.

Path Planning Optimization: Implemented and tuned dynamic path-planning algorithms to improve efficiency in navigation and reduce computation latency.

Control Systems Design: Developed PID-based controllers to ensure smooth motion and stable trajectory tracking.

Robust Performance: Validated the system in real-world scenarios involving dynamic obstacles and variable terrain.
